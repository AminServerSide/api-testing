this is a simple api tesing that i made just for practice.
it works with simple api.

how to use:
after clone or download codes, write npm install and npm update.
then, write npm start.

using postman and add api like this:

{
  "name": "name",
  "email": "name@example.com"
}

i make two branch. in branch ai i update codes with chatgpt and using design patterns.
